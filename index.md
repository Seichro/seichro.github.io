### Welcome

I’m a senior studying **Computer Science** at UT Dallas and am an active researcher in geospace.  
Currently, I work with the **Upper Atmosphere Remote Sensing Lab**, **MIT Haystack Observatory**, and **Research Center**, where I focus on radar data analysis and machine learning.

This site serves as an overview of my academic background and current research work.
