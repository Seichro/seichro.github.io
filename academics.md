# Academics
I am currently studying **computer science** with minors in **physics** and **mathematics**. I have an extremely diverse skillset which coupled with my work ethic has allowed me to learn space physics.

My interest in space physics began during my first semester of research in the UARS Lab at UT Dallas. I was developing a data-processing pipeline to handle massive volumes of Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) measurements, and what started as a programming task quickly became a fascination with the physics driving the data. The deeper I explored, the more I realized how intricate plasma behavior is. It was much more complex than any computer science concept I had studied. That realization sparked my ongoing passion for combining computational methods with the study of the upper atmosphere.

**Selected Courses:**  
- Differential Equations with Applications - In-progress
- Theoretical Physics - In-progress
- Advanced Calculus - A
- Research in Space Sciences - A
- Introduction to Electromagnetic Compatibility and Applications of RF Engineering - A
- Automata Theory - A

**Extracurricular Achievements:**
- 3x Hackathon winner at the biggest hackathons in Texas
- 3x Medalist in Collegiate Powerlifting
- 5x Dean's List
- Cybersecurity CTF winner @ Tennessee Technological University
