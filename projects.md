# Projects

Not only do I have the research and academic merits, but I also believe in the importance of applying my knowledge through impactful projects.

# [Spidey Sense](https://devpost.com/software/spidey-sense-t97br3)

Spidey Sense is an AI-powered navigation assistant for visually-impaired users that narrates the environment in real time and guides safe movement. It detects common objects with COCO-SSD, classifies them spatially into left/center/right “zones,” and speaks concise guidance via ElevenLabs. The system runs on a Node/Express backend with a voice-first frontend and includes a periodic prompt loop for continual awareness; future work targets haptics and OCR. Built with JavaScript, Node.js/Express, React, Web Speech APIs, COCO-SSD, ElevenLabs, and Auth0.

# [FaultFinder](https://devpost.com/software/faultfinder)

FaultFinder applies automated commonsense reasoning to car accidents. Given structured facts about two vehicles, it uses s(CASP) logic programming to infer who is at fault, aiming for transparent, unbiased judgments and highlighting edge cases like sudden braking or mixed infractions. The project includes a web interface that emits facts consumable by the s(CASP) engine; next steps focus on richer constraints and weighting. Built with React/JavaScript and s(CASP).

# [DriveGuardian](https://devpost.com/software/driveguardian)

DriveGuardian is an AI safety application that analyzes driving behavior (e.g., distraction, drowsiness, impaired driving, lane keeping) and delivers real-time feedback and coaching. The team prototyped models with a large driving dataset and outlined pathways for gamification, insurer partnerships, and vehicle-system integration. Built with Python, Jupyter, and YOLOv5; recognized as a *Winner — Saints Challenge* at HackAI 2023.

# [Horizon](https://devpost.com/software/horizon-c4h13j)

Horizon helps retail investors choose allocations across stocks, treasuries, and savings by targeting a risk level and optimizing expected return, using long-horizon macroeconomic factors and historical return/volatility estimates (e.g., Alpha Vantage monthly series). It was built with a Go (Gin) backend and a Vue.js frontend and deployed to Hetzner Cloud; it won *Goldman Sachs* and *HackUTD General* awards at HackUTD IX.
